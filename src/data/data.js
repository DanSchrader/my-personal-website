        p1: "Hello, I'm the worlds tallest dwarf. I left Khazad-dum in 2012, because the doors were to small and the chilis not hot enough.",
        p2: "For a few years I improved my skills as a graphic blacksmith and ran a small one-dwarf-company as a filming, audiorecording, editing, writing and designing Media Creator.",
        p3: "For 15 years I funded my self-education and start-up years as a barkeeper. That also meant a lot of fun and satisfied my interests in haptic work with ingredients.",
        p4: "Like for many others my situation changed with the upcoming pandemic. I wanted to learn something new and get rid of my Wordpress-subjection.",
        p5: "Finally I decided to learn coding from the beginning and gratuated a Web Development Bootcamp at neuefische. Here I am now: A junior frontend developer.",
        p6: "Where do I see myself in 5 years? - In a tiny house in the middle of a chili forest as a senior full-stack developer.",

        p1: "My guilty passion #1 are chilis. The hotter, the better. I must confess, I got a little addicted to Capsaicin over the last years.",
        p2: "I love to watch them grow, eat them fresh or make lovely hot seasonings and hot sauces. There is almost no food, that's better when it's not hot - in my opinion.",
        p3: "My other interests are cooking, BBQ, metal, festivals and concerts, camping, tabletop games, fantasy and ancient myths.",
